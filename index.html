        <div class="textBox">
          <p>Playing video games has been integral part of my life for as long as I can remember. I have fond memories of spending weekends with my family playing Sonic on the Sega Megadrive and watching my Mum thrash my Dad at Mortal Kombat using Sonya. <i>(I probably shouldn't have been watching Mortal Kombat at that age)</i>.</p>
          <p>
            My love for games continued to grow as did my love for strong video game mascots. As a child I was obsessed with characters like Super Mario, Crash Bandicoot, Gexx the Undercover Gecko and Spyro and some of my favourite franchises then and still to this date are Pokemon, Final Fantasy and Fable.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've known that I wanted to create video games from a very young age. Every week I would meet up with my friends and present random and strange ideas on scrap pieces of paper with no real theory or coding knowledge at all behind me, however, I just loved the idea of planning and creating. Throughout my school career I specifically remember getting into trouble in English as I had pretty much word for word rewritten the story to the original Fable game as I had played it over and over. I thought I was getting in trouble for being too similar but it was actually because apprently Teleport was not a real word. <i>For Albion!</i>
          </p>
          <p>
         During my time at High School I was pressured into getting a "real" job and as almost everyone in my family were healthcare professionals my career path began to follow this. I started working in healthcare in 2010 and currently work as a Team Leader in that same sector. In 2012 I decided that I wanted to make my passion for Video Game Development a reality so I enrolled at Kidderminster College on their Game Design course. I was very proud of my time at Kidderminster College and I left with a Distinction. I return occassionally to give advice to the students and I enjoy giving back this way. <p>My next step in education was Birmingham City University. I had been patiently waiting for any university to provide what I wanted to study, Game Design and Production. I found out that BCU were starting the course in 2017 and I enrolled immediately, I believe I was actually the first person to get a place on the course so I'll wear that with pride.</p>
              My time at BCU is where I thrived as a designer. I have been able to work with people on projects I couldn't have dreamed of before and the experience I have developed in Game Design and Project Management is invaluable.

          <p>I am currently studying for my Masters in Video Game Enterprise, Design and Production.</p>

              Artio is a Vertical Slice, 3rd Person ARPG set within a fantasy world of breathtaking beauty. You play as a young boy named Blair as you discover his heritage and grow into a demi-god. 

          <p>
              Decades ago, the world was on the verge of destruction. There was no hope, no chance for survival. Morrigan, the goddess of death summoned an army to her heel and took on the followers of Artio in direct warfare.
              Before the war could be won Artio entrusted her only son to a tribe of her devout worshipers, swearing them to secrecy. <p> He must never know who he is. His life may depend on it.
              Using the last of her power, Artio sealed Morrigan in stasis within a hidden tomb, formed from enchanted Rune Stones, before she, herself withdrew to her own enchanted tomb to regain her strength. Blair is unaware of his history and the further you play the game the more you learn about his heritage, why he is in a tribe of people who are different to him and what his purpose in the world is.
            <p>
              ARTIO was created in two weeks by two design students as part of our final major project.

              Lost Soul is a fast-paced, spell-slinging action-adventure game in which you play as a young archmage named Eeli on a grand adventure that pushes him into maturity ahead of his time.

Your world depends on it.

            Echoes Origins is a 2.5D Metroidvania game which is designed to be a prequel to the game created by the Masters' students project "Echoes". In this game you take the role of the main character Bob, a lower miner working for the Babelis, the grand structure. All around Bob his friends and colleagues begin to turn into horrific monsters due to corruption. As Bob you must ascend back to the surface and survive.
              <p>
                  The game features upgradable abilities, many enemy types including elite monsters and a variety of levels and a unique combination of 3D environment and 2D Characters. Echoes Origins was a large scale project with over 30 people working on the project.

          <p>
            Her Purgatory is a 3D top-down, four-player drop in dungeon exploring game in which a young girl is trapped in a cycle of nightmares in which her toys her hurt. You play as one of her older brother's action figures as you battle to free her from her torment.

              <p>
              In Her Purgatory there are four different classes that have been created that have their own list of skills and abilities that the player can level up and unlock in the Village Hub by killing enemies and collecting their souls. The dungeons in the game have a series of challenges including combat, puzzle and also bosses.
              </p>
            <p>
            The game was created in 3.5 weeks by a team of 6 University students as part of a Game Jam. The team was: Oliver Cullen, Joshua Bromley, Pavan Mankoo, Deniss Kaminskis, Ayrton Milner and Arthur Fostier.
